# SEC Football Database Project

MIST 4610
Project Part 2

### Project Group 6 — Haeun Bae, Dylan Ray, Mattie Comte, Tucker Herring

## Project Objective

The objective of Project Part 2 is to apply advanced SQL querying and data visualization techniques to analyze SEC college football data.
This phase focuses on generating meaningful insights through complex SQL operations and transforming results into clear, professional analytics dashboards.

By the end of the project, students demonstrate proficiency in

* Writing multi table and analytical SQL queries
* Identifying trends such as referee behavior, weather impacts, and scoring patterns
* Building Power BI dashboards from SQL outputs
* Communicating insights through managerial reasoning

## Problem Overview

After completing the database design and foundational SQL work in Part 1, Part 2 expands into **analytical storytelling**.

Students examine deeper questions, for example

* How does weather influence game outcomes
* Do strict referees affect scoring
* What trends exist in attendance across teams
* How can managers interpret scoring differentials

This phase connects database logic with data driven decision making.

## Tools and Technologies Used

* MySQL Workbench
* SQL complex queries
* Power BI Desktop
* PDF and document exports for submission

## Data Used in Part 2

The dataset includes detailed SEC football information such as

* Game outcomes
* Scoring margins
* Weather conditions
* Attendance figures
* Referee data
* Team and opponent attributes

These were queried, aggregated, and visualized to discover meaningful performance insights.


## Project Tasks Completed in Part 2

### Advanced SQL Querying

Students created **five complex SQL queries** that explored
referee strictness
weather influence
attendance patterns
scoring behavior
additional SEC analytics scenarios

Each query was tested, documented, and exported with results.

### Data Visualization and Insights

A Power BI dashboard was produced containing three major visuals

* Average Point Differential
* Average Attendance by Home Team
* Game Results by Weather

Each visualization includes written managerial reasoning explaining how a decision maker could interpret the trend.
